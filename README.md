"Leap of Faith" :

The "Leap of Faith" in recursion is a term used to describe the mindset or approach one takes when working with recursive functions. It refers to trusting that the recursive call to the function will work as intended, without needing to fully understand or trace through every recursive step.
In recursion, the "Leap of Faith" concept helps you focus on writing the base case and the recursive step clearly, and then assume that the recursive function will work correctly for smaller or simpler inputs.
